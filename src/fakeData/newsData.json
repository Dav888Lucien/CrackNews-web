      "Howard Lutnick, now U.S. Commerce Secretary, used to run a financial firm that could profit if Trump privatizes government weather services. Critics worry this would limit free weather info, especially for low-income people. Lutnickâ€™s family still controls the firm, which invests in weather-related companies. Other Trump picks also have ties to private weather businesses, raising concerns about conflicts of interest and public access to weather data."
